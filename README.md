# PositioningSystem

## 1. OBJECTIVE

In some drone shows, we can often see a large number of light-emitting drones to simulate virtual objects in the sky. Such performances usually take up a lot of space. One research direction is using some tiny Flying Light Speck (FLS) like micro-drones to compose some virtual objects. Since each FLS is small enough, so they can display a small 3d object in a higher resolution or even have some physical interaction with humans. Since the shows or interactions are dynamic, which means all FLSs are always in motion. This brings up the problem of how to determine and predict the position of each FLS. Here I am going to implement a positioning system to calculate the position of each single FLS in a display. This positioning system can effectively help FLSs to prevent collision and providers a more accurate image display and interaction feedback.

## 5. MILESTONES DETAILS

a). Looking for tools that can demonstrate beacons, FLSs.

b). Set up the environment: multiple FLSs alone with multiple receivers.

For all positioning systems (active, passive, or hybrid), receivers or beacons will be deployed in the environment. Receivers or beacons can receive signals in the active positioning system. Or send signals to FLSs in the passive positioning system. Or either work as a sender or receiver in the hybrid positioning system. 
FLS will work as a moving object and has the opposite behavior as the receiver in the different positioning systems.

c). Implement Extended Kalman Filter algorithm

Extended Kalman Filter(EKF) algorithm maintains the current and predicted device states and corrects the prediction each time a new distance sample is obtained. The simple was sent by the beacons in each time-step. Once the sample was received, FLSs will apply Extended Kalman Filter, Outlier Rejection, and Least-squares solver (LSQ) to predict or correct FLSs' location information. 

d). Add Outlier Rejection and least-squares solver (LSQ)
LSQ will minimize the mean-squared error of a set of non-linear equations.

Outlier Rejection will eliminate bad distance samples by using the output of the EKF. 

e). Set up a central database to calculate beacons that send from FLSs

FLSs will broadcast their position information, then receivers will receive the signals and send them to a central database to calculate the FLSsâ€™ position.

f). Combine both passive and active positioning system. 

This system will mainly rely on the passive positioning system. The reason is the passive positioning system provides better scalability with lower computation costs. Considering applying this system to thousands of FLSs. The passive positioning system is a better choice. When the output of the Extended Kalman Filter(EKF) in the passive positioning system detects in a bad state, then we will enable a listener to transition the system to an active positioning system. 

g). Benchmark 

Benchmark between all three systems by applying them to FLSs. Some possible comparisons:
Error Distribution for one specific FLS
How FLS moving speed affects the error distribution between all systems

## 6. CONCLUSION

This project will provide a program that can calculate the position of a FLS while it is moving. The passive positioning system will be mainly used in this project. It provides more stable scalability and requires lower computation costs. This is especially important for positioning a large number of FLSs in a display. Also, I will implement an active positioning system and a hybrid positioning system. The hybrid positioning system will be switching between the passive and active positioning systems. This ensures the advantages of lower computation and scalability while reducing errors.
